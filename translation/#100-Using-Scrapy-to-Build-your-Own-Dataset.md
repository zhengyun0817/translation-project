When I first started working in industry, one of the things I quickly realized is sometimes you have to gather, organize, and clean your own data. For this tutorial, we will gather data from a crowdfunding website called FundRazr. Like many websites, the site has its own structure, form, and has tons of accessible useful data, but it is hard to get data from the site as it doesnâ€™t have a structured API. In result, we will web scrape the site to get that unstructured website data and put into an ordered form to build our own dataset.
In order to scrape the website, we will use Scrapy. In short, Scrapy is a framework built to build web scrapers more easily and relieve the pain of maintaining them. Basically, it allows you to focus on the data extraction using CSS selectors and choosing XPath expressions and less on the intricate internals of how spiders are supposed to work. This blog post goes a little beyond the great official tutorial from the scrapy documentation in the hopes that if you need to scrape something a bit harder, you can do it on your own. With that, lets get started. If you get lost, I recommend opening the video in a separate tab.
